Three Main types of Maps:
1)HashMap 2)TreeMap 3)LinkedHashMap

Hashmap:
-fastest,  best on memory and speed
-it does not remember the order in which you insert the data

LinkedHashMap:
-not the best for memory or performance, but its only a little bit slower than hashmap
-maintains the order of inserted data

TreeMap:
-it sorts the data based on keys. and alphabetical order?
-very slower than both

FildeHandling:
-Reading/writing in data files.

-What do we need to know before we can read the data from a file?
>must have location/path of the file
>Navigate to the location where the file is stored
>Software that can help us read/write data from that file
