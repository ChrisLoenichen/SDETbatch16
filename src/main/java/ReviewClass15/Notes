Maps:
Map is a data structure that can store data in the for of key value pairs
There are three main types of maps.
Hashmap LinkedHashmap and TreeMap.

Hashmap has really good performance however does not retain the order of the data. hashmap is not thread safe
LinkedHashmap is a little slow but keeps the order of the data which is good
Treemap is the slowest but it keeps data is sorted form which

HashTable: is thread safe which means multiple cpu cores can access it
